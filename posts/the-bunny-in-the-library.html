    <p>The old campus library was Bunny's sanctuary. She didn't have a quiet corner; she was the quiet cornerâ€”a blur of soft cardigans and a perpetually lost look. He, however, was the opposite: loud laughter, perpetually late, and only seemed to enter the library when the coffee shop next door closed. Their paths should never have crossed, yet one rainy Tuesday, a shared stack of misplaced poetry books brought them together.</p><p></p><p>"Sorry," he mumbled, retrieving a volume of Keats sheâ€™d dropped. "You look like a Bunny."</p><p></p><p>She actually blushed, a rare feat. "It's my name."</p><p></p><p>He smiled, and suddenly, the dusty library seemed to fill with sunlight. He didn't mock her shyness or try to rush her from her quiet world. He just sat beside her, whispering theories about sonnets and sharing his massive, distracting headphones. Bunny realized that what she loved wasn't his volume, but the way he lowered it just for her, creating a private, perfect space in a crowded room. Their love story wasn't a sudden flash; it was the quiet, determined turning of a page, a new chapter they would always read side-by-side.</p>
