    <p>The dust from the Collapse had settled three years ago, leaving the city in muted shades of gray. Elias, a man whose hope was mostly just muscle memory, spent his days sifting through the skeletal remains of buildings, looking for anything salvageable. One evening, near what used to be the old botanical gardens, he found something impossible: a seed.</p><p></p><p>It was small, dark, and utterly unremarkable, yet it felt heavy with promise. Everything he knew told him the scorched earth couldn't support life, the air was too toxic, and the effort would be futile. But something deeper, a quiet refusal to accept the finality of the gray, made him pocket it.</p><p></p><p>Elias walked miles to the highest, clearest spot left in the city—a fragment of rooftop that caught the few hours of clean sunlight. He crumbled a handful of old, protected potting soil he’d kept hidden, placed the seed gently in the center, and covered it with a broken piece of glass, making a tiny greenhouse.</p><p></p><p>He guarded it, watered it with rations, and spoke to it, not with grand promises, but with simple, quiet statements: "Try," and "We keep going."</p><p></p><p>Weeks passed. Then, one morning, a sliver of vibrant green pushed through the dark soil. It was impossibly small, yet it radiated color with an authority the entire desolate landscape lacked. Elias didn't cheer; he didn't weep. He just sat beside the glass, breathing in the sight of it.</p><p></p><p>Hope, he realized, wasn't a guarantee of a perfect future. It was just this one, stubborn refusal to let the darkness win—a tiny, fragile point of light that proved survival wasn't the end of the story, but the start of a quiet, persistent growth.</p>
