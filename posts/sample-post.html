    <article class="post-card soft-float">
      <h2>1. The Night She Smiled</h2>
      <p>Her smile wasn’t bright—it was soft, like the moon whispering to a sleeping ocean. I remember thinking, if dreams ever learned to walk, they’d walk like her—barefoot through the stars, leaving silence full of meaning.</p>
    </article>

    <!-- Post 2 -->
    <article class="post-card soft-float">
      <h2>2. Moonlight Confessions</h2>
      <p>We spoke in glances that never met words. The moon was our witness, holding our secrets like a promise. Maybe love is just that—unspoken truths caught between two quiet souls.</p>
    </article>

    <!-- Post 3 -->
    <article class="post-card soft-float">
      <h2>3. When Dreams Touched Skin</h2>
      <p>Her presence felt unreal, like a dream I shouldn’t be awake for. Every breath she took rewrote my heartbeat, turning time into poetry I didn’t know how to stop reading.</p>
    </article>

    <!-- Post 4 -->
    <article class="post-card soft-float">
      <h2>4. The Scent of Goodbye</h2>
      <p>Even the wind remembers her perfume—soft jasmine and rain. I sometimes think she never left; she just became the air I still breathe without realizing it.</p>
    </article>

    <!-- Post 5 -->
    <article class="post-card soft-float">
      <h2>5. Starlit Promises</h2>
      <p>We made promises under the stars, foolishly believing they’d listen. Now I watch the same stars, wondering if they still keep our words between their flickering lights.</p>
    </article>

    <!-- Post 6 -->
    <article class="post-card soft-float">
      <h2>6. Her Shadow in My Sky</h2>
      <p>Even daylight couldn’t erase her. She lingers like twilight—too soft to fade, too strong to ignore. Maybe that’s what love becomes when it refuses to end.</p>
    </article>

    <!-- Post 7 -->
    <article class="post-card soft-float">
      <h2>7. Between Sleep and Memory</h2>
      <p>I met her again last night—in that space where dreams pretend to be real. She didn’t speak, yet I woke up with her voice echoing inside my silence.</p>
    </article>

    <!-- Post 8 -->
    <article class="post-card soft-float">
      <h2>8. The Taste of Rain</h2>
      <p>It rained the day she left. I stepped outside just to taste the sky, hoping maybe her goodbye would dissolve somewhere between my lips and the storm.</p>
    </article>

    <!-- Post 9 -->
    <article class="post-card soft-float">
      <h2>9. A Petal Between Pages</h2>
      <p>In an old book, I found the petal she once placed there. It’s faded now, but somehow still smells like her laughter—fragile, pink, and unforgettable.</p>
    </article>

    <!-- Post 10 -->
    <article class="post-card soft-float">
      <h2>10. Velvet Silence</h2>
      <p>Some silences are soft enough to hold. Hers was velvet—gentle, deep, wrapping around me until I forgot where loneliness ended and love began.</p>
    </article>

    <!-- Post 11 -->
    <article class="post-card soft-float">
      <h2>11. Drowning in Stardust</h2>
      <p>She spoke of love like it was gravity, pulling stars down to earth. I believed her, and now I’m drowning in constellations that all spell her name.</p>
    </article>

    <!-- Post 12 -->
    <article class="post-card soft-float">
      <h2>12. The Unfinished Poem</h2>
      <p>I tried to write her name, but the ink trembled. Maybe some stories aren’t meant to end—they just stay suspended between heartbeats and hesitation.</p>
    </article>

    <!-- Post 13 -->
    <article class="post-card soft-float">
      <h2>13. Her Eyes Knew Tomorrow</h2>
      <p>She looked at me once—and I saw the future crumble and bloom at the same time. Maybe that’s what love is: everything ending and beginning at once.</p>
    </article>

    <!-- Post 14 -->
    <article class="post-card soft-float">
      <h2>14. Midnight Letters</h2>
      <p>I still write to her sometimes—letters I’ll never send, sealed with words I can’t say aloud. The moon keeps them safe, I think, in some secret drawer of the sky.</p>
    </article>

    <!-- Post 15 -->
    <article class="post-card soft-float">
      <h2>15. Glass Butterflies</h2>
      <p>She collected moments like fragile butterflies—transparent, breakable, but beautiful. I still feel them flutter when I remember her, wings brushing against memory.</p>
    </article>

    <!-- Post 16 -->
    <article class="post-card soft-float">
      <h2>16. Her Voice Was a Season</h2>
      <p>Her laughter felt like spring waking up the world. Even now, when winter stays too long, I hear it somewhere inside and the snow begins to melt.</p>
    </article>

    <!-- Post 17 -->
    <article class="post-card soft-float">
      <h2>17. Soft Catastrophe</h2>
      <p>Love isn’t always fire. Sometimes it’s a quiet ruin—petals falling in slow motion while two hearts pretend they don’t notice the breaking.</p>
    </article>

    <!-- Post 18 -->
    <article class="post-card soft-float">
      <h2>18. The Way She Vanished</h2>
      <p>She didn’t leave suddenly; she faded like the last note of a song. I kept listening long after it ended, hoping silence might replay the memory.</p>
    </article>

    <!-- Post 19 -->
    <article class="post-card soft-float">
      <h2>19. Echoes of Her Name</h2>
      <p>Sometimes, even the wind whispers it. Her name has learned how to live without her—and yet it still comes home every night, just to ache a little more.</p>
    </article>

    <!-- Post 20 -->
    <article class="post-card soft-float">
      <h2>20. The Last Dream</h2>
      <p>I saw her once more in a dream—wearing starlight, smiling as if time never existed. When I woke, the air still smelled like her goodbye.</p>
