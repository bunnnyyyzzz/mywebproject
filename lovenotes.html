    <!-- 20 Dreamy Romantic Posts -->
    <div class="post-card">
      <h2 class="post-title">Whispers Beneath the Moon</h2>
      <p class="post-preview">She said nothing, yet the silence between us spoke louder than stars. Each breath shimmered like starlight caught in glass.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="post-card">
      <h2 class="post-title">Petals in Her Hair</h2>
      <p class="post-preview">She walked through the night garden, each step a verse, each petal clinging to her hair like a secret unspoken.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="post-card">
      <h2 class="post-title">Letters to the Wind</h2>
      <p class="post-preview">I wrote to the wind, hoping it might find her. But the breeze only sighed — as if it, too, missed her warmth.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="post-card">
      <h2 class="post-title">Midnight Conversations</h2>
      <p class="post-preview">At 2 a.m., the world sleeps — except our hearts. Her voice was softer than rain, and my soul leaned closer to listen.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="post-card">
      <h2 class="post-title">A Sky Full of Promises</h2>
      <p class="post-preview">We named the constellations after our dreams, knowing they might fade — but for one night, even the universe whispered “yes.”</p>
    </div>

    <div class="post-card">
      <h2 class="post-title">Glass Wings</h2>
      <p class="post-preview">She loved like a butterfly caught between worlds — fragile, beautiful, and too honest for the hands that tried to hold her.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="post-card">
      <h2 class="post-title">The Quiet Kiss</h2>
      <p class="post-preview">That gentle kiss echoed louder than words. My pulse is still learning her rhythm.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="post-card">
      <h2 class="post-title">Falling Into Dreamlight</h2>
      <p class="post-preview">Every time she smiled, the night tilted — as if gravity itself wanted to touch her laughter.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="post-card">
      <h2 class="post-title">Moonlight Confessions</h2>
      <p class="post-preview">We didn’t speak our truths; the moon did it for us — hanging heavy, glowing soft, daring us to believe in forever.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="post-card">
      <h2 class="post-title">Between Sleep and Memory</h2>
      <p class="post-preview">Sometimes, I dream of her. Sometimes, I wake with her name on my lips. I can’t tell which hurts more — dreaming or remembering.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="post-card">
      <h2 class="post-title">Soft Chaos</h2>
      <p class="post-preview">She was a storm in silk — chaos wrapped in calm. I loved her for the thunder she never let the world hear.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="post-card">
      <h2 class="post-title">Lanterns of Yesterday</h2>
      <p class="post-preview">We lit lanterns by the sea, each one carrying a memory we couldn’t say out loud. The tide took them gently, like forgiveness.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="post-card">
      <h2 class="post-title">The Garden After Rain</h2>
      <p class="post-preview">The flowers bowed with dew, and I swore I saw her reflection in every drop — fleeting, but impossibly real.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="post-card">
      <h2 class="post-title">Unfinished Letters</h2>
      <p class="post-preview">Every word I write ends in silence. Maybe love is just that — everything we couldn’t say, trapped in ink.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="post-card">
      <h2 class="post-title">Velvet Dusk</h2>
      <p class="post-preview">The world dimmed, and she became light — the kind that doesn’t blind but teaches your eyes how to see again.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="post-card">
      <h2 class="post-title">When the Stars Looked Back</h2>
      <p class="post-preview">She stared at the night sky and said, “Maybe they watch us too.” I believed her — because her eyes glowed brighter than any star.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="post-card">
      <h2 class="post-title">Her Name in Fireflies</h2>
      <p class="post-preview">Summer whispered her name in sparks, and I almost answered — but some magic belongs only to memory.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="post-card">
      <h2 class="post-title">Dreams Don’t Age</h2>
      <p class="post-preview">Years later, I still see her in dreams — unbroken, untouched by time, smiling like the night she first said my name.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="post-card">
      <h2 class="post-title">The Space Between</h2>
      <p class="post-preview">Sometimes, love lives in the quiet between our words — soft, fragile, and too beautiful to last forever.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="post-card">
      <h2 class="post-title">Stardust on Her Lips</h2>
      <p class="post-preview">I kissed her once, and the night never ended. Maybe that’s what eternity feels like — one heartbeat, held too long.</p>
