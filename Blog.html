        Last night felt unreal. I was lying there, half-asleep, when she quietly came closer. I offered a handshake, and instead, she pressed a soft kiss to my cheek. My heart skipped, thumped, and raced so fast I could feel it in my chest and under me, as if the bed itself was alive with it. Every second felt electric, and I never wanted it to end.
